**DAILY TAROT APP**

Every Day, I draw a Tarot card for inspiration and guidance. Now I am building an app to automate the process.

Right now, this toy app can select one of four possible cards at random, and tell you which the name of the card. Pretty straightforward.

Tech stack: Node.JS, Express, Nodemon, EJS

Upgrades to this include:  
-Add all 78 cards [DONE]  
-Allow for the possibility of inverted cards [DONE, with graphics, too!]  
-Add JPGs  [DONE]  
-Deploy  [DONE, you can see it here: https://daily-tarot.herokuapp.com]  
-Add key words for the card [DONE]  
-Mail the card to the user in a nicely formatted HTML email, automatically  
-Run as a cron job daily
