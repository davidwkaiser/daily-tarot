**DAILY TAROT APP**

Every Day, I draw a Tarot card for inspiration and guidance. Now I am building an app to automate the process. 

Right now, this toy app can select one of four possible cards at random, and tell you which the name of the card. Pretty straightforward. 

This app is currently running on a local host. 

Upgrades to this include:  
-Add all 78 cards [currently includes all Major Arcana, Wands and Cups]  
-Allow for the possibility of inverted cards [DONE!]  
-Add JPGs  
-Deploy  
-Add key words for the card  
-Run as a cron job daily  
-Mail the card to the user in a nicely formatted HTML email, automatically
