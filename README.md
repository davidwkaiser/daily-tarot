**DAILY TAROT APP**

Every day, I draw a Tarot card for inspiration and guidance. Now I am building an app to automate the process.

At first, this toy app could select one of four possible cards at random, and tell you which the name of the card. Pretty straightforward.

Upgrades to this include:<br/>
-~~Add all 78 cards~~<br/>
-~~Allow for inverted cards~~ [GRAPHICS INVERTED TOO!]<br/>
-~~Add JPGs~~ <br/>
-~~Deploy~~[You can see it here: https://daily-tarot.herokuapp.com]<br/>
-~~Add key words for the card~~ <br/>
-~~Mail the card automatically~~<br/>
-~~Add a continuous deployment pipeline~~ [INCLUDES AUTOMATED TESTING WITH TRAVIS]<br/>
-~~Run as a cron job daily~~<br/>
-~~Add metadata for SEO~~<br/>
-~~Add a cool 404 page (Tower?)~~<br/>
-Add tests [IN PROGRESS, ADDITIONAL TESTS RECENTLY ADDED]<br/>
-Mail via formatted HTML email<br/>
-Make it pretty / add styling [IN PROGRESS]<br/>
-Modify view to adapt to mobile vs desktop<br/>
-Add a database to store email addresses<br/>
-~~Add a form so you can input your email address, then mail it!~~<br/>
-~~Change email handling to a post~~<br/>
-~~Validate email input~~<br/>
-Sterilize email input<br/>
-Extend the cron job to send a daily (HTML) email to subscribers<br/>
-Add verification of email subscription<br/>
-Add Google Analytics (or determine if Heroku has analytics)<br/>
-Add a logging function [PARTIALLY DONE, WILL BE EXPANDED WHEN WE HAVE A DB]<br/>
