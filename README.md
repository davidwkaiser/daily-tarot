**DAILY TAROT APP**

Every day, I draw a Tarot card for inspiration and guidance. Now I am building an app to automate the process.

At first, this toy app could select one of four possible cards at random, and tell you which the name of the card. Pretty straightforward.

Upgrades to this include:<br/>
-Add all 78 cards [DONE]<br/>
-Allow for the possibility of inverted cards [DONE, with graphics, too!]<br/>
-Add JPGs  [DONE]<br/>
-Deploy  [DONE, you can see it here: https://daily-tarot.herokuapp.com]<br/>
-Add key words for the card [DONE]<br/>
-Mail the card to the user in a nicely formatted HTML email, automatically [IN PROGRESS, AT PROOF OF CONCEPT STAGE, NEEDS WORK TO MAIL DATA]<br/>
-Add a continuous deployment pipeline [DONE, INCLUDES AUTOMATED TESTING WITH TRAVIS]<br/>
-Add tests [IN PROGRESS, ADDITIONAL TESTS RECENTLY ADDED]<br/>
-Run as a cron job daily<br/>
-Make it pretty / add styling [IN PROGRESS]<br/>
-Add metadata for SEO [DONE]<br/>


Tech stack: Node.JS, Express, Nodemon, EJS, Jasmine, Heroku<br/>
