**DAILY TAROT APP**

Every day, I draw a Tarot card for inspiration and guidance. Now I am building an app to automate the process.

At first, this toy app could select one of four possible cards at random, and tell you which the name of the card. Pretty straightforward.

Upgrades to this include:<br/>
-~~Add all 78 cards~~<br/>
-~~Allow for inverted cards~~ [GRAPHICS INVERTED TOO!]<br/>
-~~Add JPGs~~ <br/>
-~~Deploy~~[You can see it here: https://daily-tarot-eta.vercel.app/]<br/>
-~~Add key words for the card~~ <br/>
-~~Mail the card automatically~~<br/>
-~~Add a continuous deployment pipeline~~ [INCLUDES AUTOMATED TESTING WITH TRAVIS]<br/>
-~~Run as a cron job daily~~<br/>
-~~Add metadata for SEO~~<br/>
-~~Add a cool 404 page (Tower?)~~<br/>
-~~Add a form so you can input your email address, then mail it!~~<br/>
-~~Change email handling to a post~~<br/>
-~~Validate email input~~<br/>
-Get a domain, wire up real email service with MailGun
-Add Sender Authentication<br/>
-Add tests [IN PROGRESS, ADDITIONAL TESTS RECENTLY ADDED]<br/>
-Mail via formatted HTML email<br/>
-Make it pretty / add styling [IN PROGRESS]<br/>
-Modify view to adapt to mobile vs desktop<br/>
-Add a database to store email addresses<br/>
-Sterilize email input<br/>
-Extend the cron job to send a daily (HTML) email to subscribers<br/>
-Add verification of email subscription<br/>
-Add a logging function [PARTIALLY DONE, WILL BE EXPANDED WHEN WE HAVE A DB]<br/>

To monetize:<br/>
-Add SEO<br/>
-Add Google Analytics (or determine if Render has analytics)<br/>
-Add a nice URL<br/>
-Add Google ads<br/>
-Add Google ads to email as well<br/>
-Add a DB<br/>
-~~Restore the cron~~<br/>
-Add an about page<br/>
